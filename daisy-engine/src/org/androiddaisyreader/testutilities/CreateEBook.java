 * This abstract class represents a generic "Create eBook" set of helpers.
 * 
 * Initially it will be sub-classed with a couple of classes to create DAISY 3
 * and DAISY 2.02 books. Potentially it could be extended to create ePub and
 * other zipped books. Also potentially we can add support for RTF and plain
 * text books, if demands warrant.
 * 
 * Note: the choice of an OutputStream inherently makes the output linear and
 * means we need to write end tags, etc. careful (and in the correct order if we
 * want to generate a valid xml document representing a book). However, as we
 * have control over the order, we can take advantage of the linear nature to
 * generate out-of-order (i.e. invalid) content; which may help to test error
 * handling of parsers, etc.
 * 
 * As ever, the design and implementation are expected to evolve as we learn
 * more about how to implement each format of book.
